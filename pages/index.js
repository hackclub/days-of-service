              Hack Club has launched a new initiative to help Hack Clubbers to
              share their love and passion of coding with students from
              underrepresented groups who lack access to CS education through
              one day hackathons.

            <p className="text-lg">
              The intention of the hackathon is to help other teenagers build
              their first project with code. To achieve that, the majority of
              guests will come through a nonprofit youth partner, like Girl
              Scouts of Boys and Girls Club– that specifically serves
              communities of less opportunity. And you'll be responsible for
              creating content/workshops at the beginner level for them and
              helping them ship their first project.

              Hack Club supports Days of Service by offering close personal
              support to organizers, workshops, introductions, and grants. We
              help guide you from opening your repository to the closing
              ceremony. Additionally, Hack Club provides funding for travel
              stipends and event costs. The number of mentors and people flown
              in varies depending on the number of attendees at the event. To
              ensure the event's success, Hack Club offers abundant
              documentation about past events.
